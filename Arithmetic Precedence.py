# Python follows the rule of BODMAS (Brackets, Orders [exponents/powers], Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) or
# ...PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) when giving precedence to what sign to calculate first
# Comparison operators are > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal), < (less than),
# <= (less than or equal), == (equal), != (not equal)
# '=' is the assigment operator i.e. if x is assigned the value 10, it's written as x = 10 & it means that right side value is stored in left side
# '==' is the equality operator i.e. x == 10 compares two values for equality & returns only TRUE or FALSE
# Comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal), <= (less than or equal)
# Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (floor division), % (modulus), ** (exponentiation)
# Instead of memorizing the order of precedence (see https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence), parentheses can be used
